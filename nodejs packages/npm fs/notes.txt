What is Synchronous and Asynchronous approach?  👩‍💻✍️

Every method in fs module has synchronous and asynchronous forms.


Synchronous approach: They are called blocking functions as it waits for each operation to complete,
only after that, it executes the next operation, hence blocking the next command from execution 

Asynchronous approach: They are called non-blocking functions as it never waits for each operation to complete,
rather it executes all operations in the first go itself. 

Create Files  : 👩‍💻✍️
fs.appendFile() method appends specified content to a file. If the file does not exist, the file will be created
fs.open() method takes a "flag" as the second argument, if the flag is "w" for "writing", the specified file is opened for writing. If the file does not exist, an empty file is created
fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file, containing the specified content, will be created
